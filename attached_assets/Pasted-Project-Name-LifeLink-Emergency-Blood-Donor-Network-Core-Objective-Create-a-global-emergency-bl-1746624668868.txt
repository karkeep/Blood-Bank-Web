Project Name: LifeLink - Emergency Blood Donor Network

Core Objective: Create a global emergency blood donor coordination system with a user-friendly interface and robust backend to connect verified donors with recipients in critical situations.

Frontend Requirements
1. Home Screen Structure:

Navigation Bar:

Dynamic "Recent Activity" section (displaying anonymized stats from server: recent donations, emergency requests, success stories)

Smart Login Button (changes to profile dropdown after authentication)

Emergency Request Button (prominent red floating action button)

2. Hero Section:

Top Donor Spotlight:

Interactive carousel with 3 top donors (blurred profile images over gradient overlays)

Display: Total donations | Liters donated | Lives saved

Badge system (Bronze/Silver/Gold donor tiers)

3. Geo-Analytics Dashboard:

Top Cities Visualization:

Dual heatmaps:

Top 10 cities with highest donors (green spectrum)

Bottom 10 cities needing donors (red spectrum)

Auto-detect country via IP + manual selection override

Animated bar charts with donation frequency per blood group

4. City Blood Inventory System:

Interactive map with cluster markers

Dynamic filters:

Blood type (A+/O-/etc.)

Donation recency (Last 24hrs/Week/Month)

Emergency status (Critical/Low/Stable)

Exportable data tables with city-wise stats:

Total donations

Active donors

Blood bank inventory levels

User Flow Requirements
1. Registration System:

Strict KYC Process:

Document upload (National ID + Live selfie with webcam capture)

Family verification (Parent names cross-checked with national database)

Location validation (GPS coordinates + address proof)

Medical history form (Genetic disorders, chronic illnesses, vaccination history)

2. Donor Profile:

Health Dashboard:

Visual timeline of donations

Eligibility countdown (next allowed donation date)

Blood health metrics (Hemoglobin trends, iron levels - if available)

Emergency availability toggle

3. Emergency Request System:

Smart Matching Algorithm:

Auto-prioritize donors by:

Blood type compatibility

Proximity (real-time traffic analysis)

Recent health status

Donation eligibility status

Multi-channel notifications (SMS/Email/Push/IVR call)

Live donor tracking map during emergencies

4. Donor-Requester Communication:

Encrypted chat with auto-translation

Location sharing with dynamic ETA calculation

Emergency medical info exchange (blood type confirmation, hospital details)

Admin Panel Specifications
1. Multi-Level Access Control:

Super Admin → Regional Admins → Hospital Admins

Audit trails for all critical actions

2. Fraud Prevention System:

AI-powered document verification

Behavior analysis for scam detection

Report management dashboard with case prioritization

3. Real-Time Monitoring:

Global blood inventory heatmap

Emergency request tracker with escalation protocols

Donor-recipient matching analytics

4. Advanced Features:

Disaster mode activation (mass casualty events)

Blood shortage prediction models

Mobile blood drive coordination module
